# Maze-Generator-and-Solver

Class project for Data Structures at Amherst College in April 2018. Purpose of the project was to implement a unionfind data structure and execute depth-first search to generate and solve mazes.


Generator: Prints random maze of specified dimensions

    
    to run java MazeGenerator num, where num = the length/width of the maze

Solver: Prints the inputed maze and solution path.

    
    to run java MazeSolver maze_file.txt
    Maze_5.txt, Maze_10.txt, Maze_25.txt are example maze files.
